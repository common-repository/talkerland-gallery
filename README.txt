This is a simple yet versatile image gallery plugin, based on jQuery Blueimp Gallery open source code, for WordPress users.

== Description ==
Talkerland Gallery is a simple yet versatile image gallery plugin for WordPress bloggers, and it uses jQuery Blueimp Gallery Open Source Code as its core.

It is fairly easy to install and easy to use even for bloggers who donâ€™t know about HTML, CSS, or Javascript at all. It supports both thumbnail and carousel gallery modes, and inherits basic features of Blueimp Gallery.

Currently, Talkerland Gallery only supports the image gallery features of Blueimp Gallery, but the original Blueimp open source code supports the video gallery features as well. The video gallery part will be implemented in the future version.
